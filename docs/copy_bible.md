# Copy Bible: Inclusive Copy Guidelines

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-30

## Core Principles

1. **Simple & Direct**: Use short sentences (max 20 words) and grade 6 vocabulary.
2. **Positive Outcome**: Focus on what the user achieves, not what they destroy or lose.
3. **Second Person**: Address the user as "you". Avoid "we", "our", "I", "me" (except legal).
4. **Scannable**: Use bold headings and concise button labels (3-4 words).

## Word List

### ✅ Allowed (Use This)

- **Remove**: Use instead of "Delete" for removing items.
- **Sign out**: Use instead of "Log out".
- **Your**: Use for possessives (e.g., "Your steps").
- **Save**: Positive action.
- **Turn on**: Clear action.
- **Information**: Use instead of "Warning" for alerts.
- **Note**: Neutral alert.

### ❌ Do Not Use (Avoid This)

- **Delete**: Too negative. Use "Remove".
- **Log out**: Phrasal verb can be ambiguous. Use "Sign out".
- **Warning**: Alarmist. Use "Information" or "Note".
- **Careful**: Alarmist.
- **Danger**: Alarmist.
- **Beware**: Alarmist.
- **We / Our / Us**: Do not speak for the app/company.
- **I / Me / My**: Do not put words in the user's mouth (except legal "I agree").
- **e.g. / i.e. / etc.**: Latin abbreviations are hard to read. Use "for example", "that is", "and so on".
- **vs. / cf.**: Latin abbreviations. Use "versus", "compare".

## Formatting Rules

- **Sentence Case**: Use sentence case for ALL text (headings, buttons, labels).
  - ✅ "Save photo"
